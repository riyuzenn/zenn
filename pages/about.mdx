# about me

glad you came here. i'm riyuzenn, but i prefer just zenn. i started my programming journey 
for several years ago & i've been using the internet for a decade. with that amout of time, i managed to learned several languages including 
<a className="text-white" href="">python</a>, <a className="text-white" href="">javascript</a>, <a className="text-white" href="">typescript</a>, and <a className="text-white" href="">c#</a>.
yet still learning <b>c/c++</b> & <b>rust</b>. 
<br />

as i said on the main page, i do love building things from scratch. infact, this website is written from scratch using nextjs
& tailwind css (<a className="text-white" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/riyuzenn/zenn">repo</a>). full stack development is one of
my skills -- please just make me stick with backend stuff & devops, frontend is painful -- using other js / ts frameworks. if you like to know what tech stack & technologies i use:

<br />

- git (srsly, who don't use git?)
- fastapi (backend)
- express (backend)
- nextjs / react (frontend)
- tailwindcss (frontend)
- wpf & .net (windows app)
- vscode (text editor i used when using windows)
- nvim (text editor i used when using linux distro)
- windows & ubuntu / arch (os that i use (dual boot))

## some facts about me

i prefer working solo & independently. however there are some instance i like to work with friends & colleagues.
occasionally i'm socially anxious. when my anxiety hits in, i have no choice but to ignore or even cut communication with you. 
for those i cuts off all communication without explaining, i'm deeply sorry. sometimes, i could'nt help myself. lastly, don't
ask anything related to designing or game development. those things i hate the most. as a matter of fact, i raged quit the entire field
of game development because i wasn't able to design a 2d character, yes a <b>2D CHARACTER</b>.
